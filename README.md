# dymiumExampleProject

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This is an example setup of a microsimulation project using the
[dymiumCore](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumCore) package.

  - See the `scenarios` folder for example use-cases.

## Try this on Rstudio.cloud\!

I have also setup this project on Rstudio.cloud that you can try. The
link is [here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/855365). Note that, our
Rstudio.cloudâ€™s workspace that hosts this repository has a very limited
amount of cpus and RAM. Hence it would be best to clone to project and
run it on your local machine. I already sent a request to Rstudio to
grant us more computing resources and we should hear back from them very
soon.
