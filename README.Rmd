# dymiumExampleProject

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an example setup of a microsimulation project using the [dymiumCore](https://github.com/dymium-org/dymiumCore) package. See the `scenarios` folder for example use-cases.

## Try the example project Rstudio.cloud!

You can try this project on Rstudio.cloud using this [link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/855365), an Rstudio cloud account is required. Note that, our Rstudio.cloud's workspace that hosts this repository has a limited amount of cpus and RAM, so it would be best to clone this project and run it on your local machine, if possible.

## Need help building a microsimulation model using `dymiumCore`?

Please file an issue in this repo and I will gladly help you build your first microsimulation model using `dymiumCore`! :)
